# 🚀 Quick Database Setup Guide

## Step 1: Set Up Your Database URL

Add to your `.env` file (create if it doesn't exist):

```bash
# For local PostgreSQL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/clickfunnels_db"

# For SQLite (easier for testing)
# DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# For Supabase/Neon/other hosted Postgres
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database?sslmode=require"
```

## Step 2: Push Schema to Database

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database (creates all tables)
npx prisma db push

# Or create a migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial_setup
```

## Step 3: Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```
