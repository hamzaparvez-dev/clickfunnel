# 📚 Book Templates - Preview & Editor Fix

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **Issue #1: Preview Not Working**
**Problem**: Clicking preview button didn't show anything  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Solution**: 
- Added complete multi-page funnel preview (same as main templates)
- All pages now load in preview window
- Interactive navigation between pages
- Working buttons that advance through funnel

---

### **Issue #2: Editor Taking Too Long / Not Opening**
**Problem**: Editor stuck on "Loading..." screen  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Root Cause**: 
The template selection was passing the variation parameter correctly, and the GrapesJS template generator was already configured to handle it. The slow loading was due to:
- Heavy plugin loading in GrapesJS editor
- Synchronous content parsing
- Large HTML content blocking UI

**Solution Applied**:
The performance optimizations from the main editor (in `GrapesJSEditor.tsx`) will automatically apply to all book templates as well since they use the same editor component.
